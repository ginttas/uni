    "### How will research projects 1, 2, 3 will proceed\n",
    "- The outcome of these projects should be some kind of scientific novelty (mokslo naujovÄ—)\n",
    "- This could be some kind of improvement to existing solution, but it shouldn't had been presented anywhere else.\n",
    "- In moodle there should be a list of topics (It just started to be entered, in a week or two there should be much more)\n",
    "- We can select a topic form a list, or we can propose our own topic\n",
    "- A mentor can only be person with Doctors degree\n",
    "- Currently at this program there are 30 lt and 8 en students\n",
    "- There is a list of old topics at moodle\n",
    "- During project lessons we discus about our research\n",
    "    - Help for choosing topic\n",
    "    - Help to formulate goals\n",
    "    - etc.\n",
    "- Master degree topic and supervisor should be selected by 2022-10-14 (2022-10-21 submitted to ktu)\n",
    "- Presentation and initial review (by 2022-11-11)\n",
    "- Topic can be corrected (If in the same field only my supervisor should approve, else a bit more hassle)\n",
    "- 3, 4, 5 week there will be more details to what has to be done\n",
    "- Before selecting topic we have to define what we want to do, what already exists, ..., feasibility analysis\n",
    "- During presentation we need to have 2-3 slides a bout our topic\n",
    "    - Title\n",
    "    - Main idea\n",
    "    - etc.\n",
    "- 2022-12-09/16 Another presentation\n",

    "### Grading\n",
    "- 10% Private defense (In class)\n",
    "- 90% Public defense (As in bachelor's final work)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we will present?\n",
    "- Depends on the topic\n",
    "- In most cases slides are sufficient\n",
    "- Commission can ask for actual \"work\" if it's needed\n",
    "- Difference form bachelor's project - we don't need complete project\n",
    "- We just need to show some results (That our algorithm is working)\n",
    "- The product is our novelty\n",
    "- The first semester only analysis or also results? In short - initial review of our field, what is used, what exist, etc\n",
    "- Next semester - to start implementation, choose technologies\n",
    "- Next one would be - experimentation\n",
    "- Final semester - for finalization"
